    <h1>UX‑SEO Audit Agent</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>UX‑SEO Audit Agent</strong> is an open‑source project that
      automates the assessment of a website’s user experience (UX) and
      search engine optimisation (SEO). It combines open‑source tools such as
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google
        Lighthouse</a> with custom HTML parsing and optional AI
      recommendations to deliver a concise audit. You can use this tool to
      benchmark your site against a competitor, identify quick wins and
      prioritise improvements.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Combines UX and SEO metrics in a single report.  The tool collects
        titles, meta descriptions, headings, links, images and alt text,
        measures page speed and weight, and records canonical tags,
        robots meta, Open Graph metadata, structured data, responsive
        viewport hints and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyses readability (Flesch score) and tone.  It counts words,
        sentences and syllables to compute a reading ease score, looks for
        personal pronouns and exclamation marks to infer whether the copy
        is formal or informal, and even extracts the top keywords on a
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Visualises page composition via a simple heatmap of headings,
        images, links and word counts.  This offers a quick snapshot of
        where your content is concentrated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Highlights keyword gaps by comparing your page’s top terms to a
        competitor’s.  If the competitor covers topics you don’t, they
        appear here as opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alerts gambling and betting sites to include responsible gaming
        notices and age restrictions.  The tool looks for words like
        “casino”, “poker” or “jeu” in the domain and, if found, checks
        whether the page contains a responsible gambling message and an
        age restriction (18+ or 21+).
      </li>
      <li>
        Benchmarks against competitor URLs and shows the difference in
        scores, word counts and readability.  You can therefore see at a
        glance where you outshine your competition and where you fall
        behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Presents results in a modern, card‑based interface inspired by
        Framer.  The Streamlit app groups metrics, heatmaps and
        suggestions into clean panels with consistent typography and soft
        shadows, making the audit easier to read at a glance.
      </li>
      <li>Runs from the command line and integrates with CI pipelines</li>
      <li>Optional AI‑generated recommendations via OpenAI</li>
      <li>Exports data as JSON (extendable to other formats)</li>
    </ul>
