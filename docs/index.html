    <h1>UX‑SEO Audit Agent</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>UX‑SEO Audit Agent</strong> is an open‑source project that
      automates the assessment of a website’s user experience (UX) and
      search engine optimisation (SEO). It combines open‑source tools such as
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google
        Lighthouse</a> with custom HTML parsing and optional AI
      recommendations to deliver a concise audit. You can use this tool to
      benchmark your site against a competitor, identify quick wins and
      prioritise improvements.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Combines UX and SEO metrics in a single report.  The tool collects
        titles, meta descriptions, headings, links, images and alt text,
        measures page speed and weight, and records canonical tags,
        robots meta, Open Graph metadata, structured data, responsive
        viewport hints and ARIA attributes for accessibility.  It also
        checks for semantic landmarks like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, which improve both SEO and screen‑reader navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyses readability (Flesch score) and tone.  It counts words,
        sentences and syllables to compute a reading ease score, looks for
        personal pronouns and exclamation marks to infer whether the copy
        is formal or informal, and even extracts the top keywords on a
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Computes a <strong>Layout Score</strong> and visual‑hierarchy metrics.  Instead of
        asking you to upload a screenshot, the app derives a score from
        ratios of headings, images and links relative to the total word
        count and counts how many semantic landmarks (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>) are present.  A balanced
        ratio (e.g. roughly three headings per thousand words) suggests
        a clear hierarchy, while extreme values indicate clutter or
        sparsity.  The app displays these ratios alongside the Layout
        Score and offers suggestions on how to improve your page
        structure and legibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detects <strong>conversion and growth signals</strong> and computes a <strong>Business
        Score</strong>.  In addition to counting calls‑to‑action (CTA) buttons or
        links, scanning for trust‑building words such as “SSL”, “licence” and
        “avis clients” and tallying the number of forms on the page, the
        analyser looks for a wider set of business cues: social proof
        (testimonials, reviews, ratings), promotions and bonuses, explicit
        benefits, comparison phrases (“vs”, “comparatif”), cross‑sell or
        recommendation hints, the presence of a FAQ or help section and the
        availability of a search bar.  To make these metrics actionable, it
        normalises them per 1 000 words and derives a Business Score out of 100
        with key performance indicators such as CTA/1 000 words and
        trust/1 000 words.  Ratios outside recommended ranges prompt
        targeted suggestions.  These KPIs and the Business Score appear in
        the Conversion and Growth tabs, along with the CTA texts, trust
        keywords and growth signals detected.  You can then see at a glance
        which business elements to add or refine to improve credibility,
        usability and conversion rate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Highlights content gaps by comparing your page’s top keywords and
        H2 headings with those of a competitor.  If the competitor covers
        topics or sections you don’t, they appear here as opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alerts gambling and betting sites to include responsible gaming
        notices and age restrictions.  The tool looks for words like
        “casino”, “poker” or “jeu” in the domain and, if found, checks
        whether the page contains a responsible gambling message and an
        age restriction (18+ or 21+).
      </li>
      <li>
        Notes missing semantic landmarks and low ratios of ARIA labels,
        encouraging better structure and inclusivity for assistive
        technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Benchmarks against competitor URLs and shows the difference in
        scores, word counts and readability.  You can therefore see at a
        glance where you outshine your competition and where you fall
        behind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zoning &amp; competitor examples</strong>.  All recommendations are grouped by
        page zones – Meta, Navigation &amp; Header, Hero &amp; CTA, Main Content,
        Trust &amp; Social Proof, Growth &amp; Promotions, Footer &amp; Compliance,
        Accessibility &amp; Semantic, and Design &amp; UX – so you can see which
        part of the page needs attention.  When you provide a competitor
        URL, the audit highlights where the competitor excels (e.g., more
        CTAs, stronger trust signals) so you can visualise successful
        patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Presents results in a modern, card‑based interface inspired by
        Framer.  The Streamlit app groups metrics, scores and
        suggestions into clean panels with consistent typography and soft
        shadows, making the audit easier to read at a glance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced result interpretation</strong>.  Numerical scores are accompanied by
        qualitative labels (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) and short
        progress bars so you can quickly grasp the overall performance and
        see how close the page comes to the maximum score.  When a
        competitor URL is provided, a small bar chart compares your
        page’s UX/SEO, layout and business scores with those of the
        competitor, highlighting relative strengths and weaknesses at a
        glance.  Detailed raw metrics and lists of call‑to‑action texts or
        trust keywords are tucked away behind expandable sections,
        keeping the main view tidy while still providing access to the
        underlying data.
